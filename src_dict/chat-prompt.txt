I am designing an **open, multilingual, non-profit dictionary**.

The dictionary clearly separates system structure from linguistic content. 
The system structure describes how data is organized and connected; for this reason, 
its fields use English, which is the standard language of programming and 
ensures long-term consistency and interoperability.

Linguistic content describes how a word works inside a specific language. 
These fields must be written in the language being described, so that native speakers, 
teachers, and tutors can maintain entries (in JSON) without needing technical knowledge or English terminology.

When a local concept needs to connect to the global system, global identifiers in English are used, 
together with a local mapping in the dictionary’s language. This keeps the data easy for 
humans to edit while remaining clear and reliable for computers.

This project has the following goals:
- It is focused on the words required for basic language competency for everyday situations.
- **Each lemma and each sense** lives in its own **monolingual JSON file**.
- JSON must be **human-maintainable** by teachers, tutors, and native speakers with minimal technical knowledge.
- The system must be **language-agnostic** so that it can support English, Spanish, Japanese, and any other language from the beginning.
- The system determines the proficiency level for each sense, and for each sense uses a definition within that same proficiency level. 
- The dictionary must support:
   * grammatical properties (gender, number, countability, etc.)
   * regional variation
   * register (formal, informal, vulgar, técnico)
   * polysemy (separate senses per lemma)
   * etymology
   * examples
   * idioms, proverbs or sayings
   * nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs that are most often used with this word
   * semantic domains
   * stable sense IDs
   * cross-lingual translation links
- Part-of-speech must use **Universal Dependencies (UD)** tags.
  The schema must support meanings that are shared between adjectives and nouns.
- There is audio for each term and example.
   When available, also with different speakers, and from different regions.
- The dictionary must be published **for free**, **ad-free**, with an **anti-commercial license** (CC BY-NC-SA or stronger), and ideally **hosted on static infrastructure** (GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages).
- Translation support must be enabled by linking sense IDs across languages.
- We want to consider a design that allows for:
   * fast client-side search
   * static hosting
   * no backend server (or minimal free server if needed)
- The project should avoid sensitive or proprietary data; everything must be **open and shareable**.

We’ve already designed several schema ideas. 
So I will provide you with the TypeScript definitions, which I want you to acknowledge without immediate comment.
Please comment again once I start asking you questions.
